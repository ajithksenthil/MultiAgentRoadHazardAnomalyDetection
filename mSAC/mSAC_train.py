# Modifications:
# - Support for Multiple Agents: The script now handles multiple agents. It expects the environment to return lists of states, actions, and rewards corresponding to each agent.
# - Replay Buffer Interaction: Adjusted to work with the modified multi-agent replay buffer. Each agent's experiences are stored and sampled separately.
# - Agent Updates: Each agent is updated with its own batch of experiences.

# Additional Considerations:
# - Environment Setup: Ensure that your `CarlaEnv` class is capable of handling multiple agents and returning their respective states and rewards.
# - Action and State Spaces: The dimensions of action and state spaces (`env.action_size` and `env.state_size`) should align with what your environment and agents expect.
# - Model Saving and Performance Evaluation: Implement logic to periodically save models and evaluate their performance, which is crucial for long training runs and analysis.

# '''
# Key Components:
# - Initialization: Set up the environment, agents, and replay buffer.
# - Looping Over Episodes: Each episode corresponds to a run of the simulation.
# - Action Selection: Each agent selects an action based on the current state.
# - Environment Step: Apply the actions to the environment and observe the next state and reward.
# - Replay Buffer: Store experiences (state, action, reward, next state, done) in the buffer.
# - Agent Update: Sample a batch from the replay buffer and update each agent's parameters.
# - Logging and Saving: Print out rewards for monitoring and save models periodically.

# Additional Considerations:
# - Hyperparameters: Define or tune hyperparameters such as learning rates, buffer size, discount factor, etc.
# - Environment Interface: Ensure the environment provides the necessary methods (reset, step) and properties (state_size, action_size).
# - Agent Methods: Ensure the Agent class has methods for selecting actions (select_action) and updating parameters (update_parameters).
# - Error Handling: Include error handling and validation checks as needed.

# This script forms the core training loop for the mSAC algorithm. Fill in specifics related to your environment and agents, and consider adding functionality for evaluation, logging, and model saving as per your requirements.
